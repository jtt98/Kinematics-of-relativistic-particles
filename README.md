# Kinematics-of-relativistic-particles
This repository includes a work on kinematics in Relativity from a geometrical point of view. The so-called MUA, MDU and MCU are defined, giving geometrical characterizations and results that ensure the completeness of the trajectories followed by these motions.

It is the result of two enjoyed scholarships of initiation to research and collaboration in the Department of Geometry and Topology of the University of Granada during my last two years of graduation.
